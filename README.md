# Star Cluster Kinematic Classification Project

## Overview

This project implements a machine learning approach to classify star clusters with the most basic classifications (Open vs. Globular) based primarily on their kinematic properties. It uses data from the Gaia DR3 missions data acquisition, analysis, and machine learning.

This project was created for the Astronomy Prompt in the STEAM Innovation Challenge 2025.

## To run the classifier:
1. Install dependencies
   You can install them using pip:
   
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
2. If you want to run `1_data_acquisition.py`, delete `cleaned_cluster_members.fits` to create it again. Or, you can directly run `2_ml_classification.py` to view the classifier in action!

## Features

* Queries the Gaia DR3 archive for stellar data associated with known star clusters.
* Applies astrometric and kinematic filters to identify likely cluster members.
* Calculates cluster-level kinematic features, including:
    * Internal velocity dispersion (3D and components)
    * Orbital parameters (Energy, Angular Momentum Lz) using the `gala` library.
* Trains a Random Forest classifier to distinguish between Open and Globular clusters based on these kinematic features.
* Evaluates the model's performance using standard metrics (accuracy, precision, recall, confusion matrix).
* Identifies the most important kinematic features for the classification task.

## Project Structure

* `1_data_acquisition.py`: Script to query Gaia, clean data, and save likely cluster members to `cleaned_cluster_members.fits`.
* `2_ml_classification.py`: Script to load cleaned data, perform feature engineering, train the Random Forest model, and evaluate its performance. Outputs evaluation metrics and plots (`confusion_matrix.png`, `feature_importance.png`).
* `CODE_EXPLANATION.md`: Detailed explanation of the Python scripts.
* `README.md`: This file.
* `cleaned_cluster_members.fits`: Sample, cleaned .fits file generated by data_acquisition script. Delete this file to run the first script.

## Dependencies

This project requires Python 3.x and the following libraries:

* numpy
* pandas
* astropy
* astroquery
* scikit-learn
* gala-astro
* matplotlib
* seaborn
